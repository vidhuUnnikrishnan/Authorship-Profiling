# Authorship Profiling

The analyses involving studying of stylistic choices of tweets/documents are called Authorship Analysis. Apart from identifying the gender, these types of analyses can be used in author profiling with age, native language and other traits. These studies are vastly used in plagiarism detection, consumer study, fake comments recognition, customer segmentation, forensic analysis, crime investigation and much more (Roy, 2019).
In this assignment, we are focusing on predicting the gender of 500 documents of tweets by using another 3100 training examples. We are using different natural language processing steps to extract features from these tweets. The models we are using in this study are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost and Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron). We have used multiple features to study these models and chose the best to predict the test labels.
